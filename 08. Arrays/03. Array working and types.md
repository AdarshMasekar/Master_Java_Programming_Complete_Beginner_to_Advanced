# Arrays working and types

* Uninitialized arrays will have default value as :

| datatype | default value |
| -------- | ------------- |
| int      | 0             |
| float    | 0.0           |
| short    | 0             |
| byte     | 0             |
| long     | 0             |
| double   | 0.0           |
| char     | -             |
| boolean  | false         |

* All items in array should be of same  data type
* Primitives are stored in a contiguous locations
* Non-Primitives are stored in a contiguous locations

### **Adavantages of Arrays:**

* Random access
* Cache Friendly


### Disadvantages of Arrays:

* Insertion and deletion are slow
* Searching is also slow if not sorted

### Array types 

**based on dimensions :**

1. one dimension array
2. multi dimension array

**based on size :**

1. Fixed size( Normal Array)
2. Dynamic size( ArrayList, Vector)
